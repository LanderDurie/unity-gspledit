\section{Anchor Points}

To generate links we need points to link to. Each link is defined between a Gaussian point and a finite set of anchor points on the mesh. For the Gaussian point, the choice is easy as the center is given and works perfectly as a reference. For the mesh, choosing such anchor points becomes more difficult. Anchor points should serve as representative points, summarizing the local surface properties of the mesh. Multiple approaches for defining anchor points can be chosen.

\subsection{Vertex Anchors}

The first and most obvious choice is to pick the vertices of the mesh as possible anchors. This means that each splat
